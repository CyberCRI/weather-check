## Weather Check

A tool to pick up on inclusivity problems at the workplace.

### Description 

The goal of this tool is for people to anonymously point out issues with inclusivity, such as when they feel ignored by others. The concept is to link this with activities designed to encourage inclusivity when needed.

## How to Use

The tool works a bit like Doodle. There is an organizer who sets up the poll and sends around a link to a form for others to fill in. When the organizer wishes, they can visit the "weather" screen and show the results (such as letting it play on a projector in the entrance to a building).

1. The organizer goes to http://wc.crigamelab.org/group and clicks "Make a new group"
2. The organiser names the group. The system provides two links. It's important to _copy down the links_ because there is no way to recover them otherwise.
3. The organizer sends the provided poll link around for others to fill in. 
4. When enough people have answered (or when the time comes), the organiser clicks the "check out the weather" link and projects it on the wall. 

## Requested feedback 

What percent of people participate? What percent of people report problems? Are there any common problems given in the "other" box that we hadn't thought of?
